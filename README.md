# CLVPrediction
Customer Lifetime Value Prediction for Retailers 📊🛒
Project Description
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for Retailers, using a fictitious online retail company specializing in electronics, clothing, and home goods data. By leveraging predictive analytics and customer segmentation techniques, this project provides actionable insights to enhance customer retention, optimize marketing strategies, and drive revenue growth.

The model utilizes historical customer transaction data to predict how much a customer will contribute over the course of their relationship with the Retailers, helping the company make data-driven decisions.

Features 🌟
CLV Prediction:
A Random Forest Regressor model to provide accurate CLV predictions based on customer behavior and transaction history.
RFM Analysis:
Segmentation of customers into high-value, medium-value, and low-value groups based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) scores.
Key Drivers and Insights:
Identification of significant predictors of CLV, including total amount spent, number of purchases, customer lifespan, and engagement scores.
Customer Segmentation Recommendations:
Actionable strategies for improving customer retention and engagement, tailored to each customer segment.

Usage Instructions 📝
Prepare the Data:

Ensure your transaction and customer data is placed in the data/ folder and follows the required format as described in the documentation.
Run Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Open the eda.ipynb notebook and execute the cells to visualize key trends and insights into customer behavior.
Train and Evaluate the CLV Model:

Execute the clv_prediction.ipynb notebook to train the Random Forest Regressor model and evaluate its performance using baseline models like OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) and KNN.
Perform RFM Analysis:

Run the RFM segmentation script (rfm_analysis.py) to segment customers and analyze trends within high, medium, and low-value groups.
Generate Insights:

Utilize the visualizations and statistical analysis to generate actionable strategies for marketing and retention efforts.

Key Findings 📈
Model Performance:

The Random Forest Regressor achieved an R-squared score of 77.7% and the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 28,781.85.
RFM Insights:

High-value customers have the highest monetary and frequency scores.
Medium-value customers show unexpectedly high recency scores.
Low-value customers demonstrate potential for increased engagement and value with targeted efforts.
Significant Predictors of CLV:

Total amount spent, number of purchases, and customer lifespan were identified as the strongest predictors of CLV.
Recommendations 📋
Model Deployment:

Deploy the Random Forest Regressor model to predict CLV and guide marketing efforts such as personalized offers and promotions.
Customer Retention:

Implement loyalty programs and personalized incentives for high-value customers to increase customer lifetime.
Engagement Strategies:

Investigate factors contributing to high recency scores in medium-value customers and target engagement efforts toward these segments.
Data-Driven Marketing:

Use demographic insights (e.g., age, gender) to create age-specific campaigns and product recommendations.
Limitations and Challenges ⚠️
Data Quality:

Sparse or biased data may affect the accuracy of CLV predictions, especially if certain customer segments are underrepresented.
Cold Start Problem:

New customers with insufficient purchase history may pose challenges in making accurate CLV predictions.
Computational Bottlenecks:

Handling large datasets may require optimization for better scalability and processing speed.
